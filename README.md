# GPMDP-Controller
A simple application to control Google Play Music Desktop Player using an Xbox controller.
This project is currently very, VERY early stages but works using GPMDP's JSON API.

Controller Mappings
At present the controller mappings can't be changed without modifying the code. Also many of the buttons are just mapped to Play/Pause. Both of these are things which will be addressed in the near future.
The controller is mapped as follows:
Xbox Button (doesn't seem to work) - Play/Pause
             Back - Play/Pause
            Start - Play/Pause
                A - Play/Pause
                B - Toggle Repeat
                X - Toggle Shuffle
                Y - Play/Pause
          DPad Up - Volume Up
        DPad Down - Volume Down
        DPad Left - Back (once to go to the beginning of the song, twice to go back a song)
       DPad Right - Forward to the next song
 Left Stick Press - Play/Pause
Right Stick Press - Play/Pause
    Left Shoulder - Toggle Thumbs Down
   Right Shoulder - Toggle Thumbs Up
